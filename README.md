# README

This is a stripped down Rails API for the purposes of working with Docker tools. It was presented by Keith Beckman on 2018.02.11 as part of a virtual meetup.

My notes from that meetup have been copied below. The latest version can be found in [my notational velocity repo](https://github.com/paulbaker3/notational_notes/blob/master/No%20Noobs%20Meetup%20Notes.md)

The code was forked from github.com/kbeckman/test_api
